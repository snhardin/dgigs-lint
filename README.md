# eslint-config-dgigs

Scott's opinionated eslint config, common between most of his projects.

## Usage

* **Note:** It's assumed that you are using `typescript` with `jest` for testing for now.

Put this in your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    extends: ['eslint-config-dgigs/full'],
};
```
